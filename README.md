# Android-Documentation-API-Level-24
This is the documentation for the Android SDK API Levels 24 and below. 

#Installation
It's pretty simple to install, just download it and open up the `packages.html` file on your favorite web browser.

##Why I did this
I decided to download the documentation directly from Android Developer site because the documentation that can be downloaded from the Android SDK Manager is availble for up to API version 23 and it is a bit buggy. I used [HTTRACK](http://www.httrack.com/) to download the entirety of the documentation, which by the way includes the Java SE8 documentation as well (Everything from Collections to JavaFX). Two birds down with one stone!
